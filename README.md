# CS 499 Computer Science Capstone

### Professional Self-Assessment
Hi, my name is Russell Reckhow and I am finishing up my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University. This program gave me the chance to test my skills on real projects and see how computer science connects to solving problems.

Building this ePortfolio shows my growth and skills I will use in my career. I focused on three areas: 
- Software Design and Engineering
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Databases

For these, I used my Weight Tracker Android app as my main artifact. I added a line graph for design, a merge sort for algorithms, and a notes section for databases. These changes highlight that I can improve an app’s design, apply algorithms in real code, and manage data in a useful way.

Building this portfolio also gave me the chance to reflect on what I’ve learned. I worked on communicating my code, thinking about efficiency, and designing features that make sense to users. I also built a stronger mindset around security, making sure inputs are handled safely and features work as expected. Altogether, this portfolio shows that I can plan, explain, and deliver software that works.

In this video, I walked through the original Weight Tracker app, explained the existing functionality, and described the enhancements I planned for design, algorithms, and databases.

### [Artifact: Weight Tracker App](https://github.com/Russrecker/CS-499-Computer-Science-Capstone/tree/main/Artifact-Weight-Tracker)
The Weight Tracker app was built in my CS360 Mobile Architect & Programming course. It lets users log weight entries, track their goal, and now includes added features through my enhancements.

#### Original version included:
- Login system
- Weight logging
- Goal weight entry
- SMS notifications

#### Enhanced version includes:
- Line graph (Software Design and Engineering)
- Merge sort for entries (Algorithms and Data Structures)
- Notes section (Databases)

This artifact works well for my ePortfolio because it ties together multiple areas of computer science into one project.

---

### Enhancement 1 - Software Design and Engineering
I added a line graph that shows weight entries over time. This makes progress easier to see and improves the app’s usability. While doing this, I learned how to integrate third-party chart libraries and keep data organized for display. This enhancement shows my ability to design features that connect code to a better user experience.

---

### Enhancement 2 - Algorithms and Data Structures
I added a merge sort to organize the weight entries. This keeps the graph and list view consistent and shows that I can apply algorithms in practice. It also gave me the chance to compare built-in sorting with implementing an algorithm directly. This enhancement shows that I can solve problems with data and improve efficiency where needed. 

---

### Enhancement 3 - Databases
I built a notes section that uses the SQLite database. Now users can save comments or details with each weight entry. This enhancement gave me experience designing a table, connecting it with the app, and making sure new data shows right away. It shows that I can design and manage databases inside an application.
